## Course: Digitization

**Project Goal**
The goal of this project is to perform a 3D photogrammetric reconstruction of the statue on the Bridge of Civilizations in Skopje, aiming to create a virtual model that presents the statue in a three-dimensional format on a website.

## Project Description
The project will be carried out using 3D photogrammetry techniques, which will enable the collection of accurate data about the shape and details of the statue. The statue will be photographed from various angles to capture all details and aspects.

## Project Phases and Activities

| Phase                    | Activities                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Preparation and Planning | - Identify the location of the statue and obtain the necessary permits for work.               |
|                          | - Analyze the environment and conditions of the site for photography.                          |
|                          | - Prepare the photogrammetry equipment.                                                        |
| Photographing the Statue | - Photograph the statue from different angles and positions.                                   |
|                          | - Ensure high-quality photographs for a good reconstruction.                                   |
| Data Processing          | - Process the photographs using appropriate 3D photogrammetry software.                         |
|                          | - Create a three-dimensional model of the statue.                                               |
| Evaluation and Materialization | - Review and evaluate the reconstructed model.                                               |
|                               | - Make necessary corrections and materialize the model if needed.                              |
| Documentation and Presentation | - Document the process and results of the project.                                           |
|                               | - Present the final model and project report.                                                 |
